Bcash is the most advanced cryptocurrency on earth.


300kb blocks
-------------

Central planning is essential for a strong economy. A small block size is great because it ensures high fees and deters people from using BCash, keeping our blockchain lean and small in size. 

NoWitness
----------

According to Twitter polls, 90% of users do not verify signatures, therefore we removed all signatures from bcash. Thanks to this space-saving optimization, you can now run a full bcash node on your iwatch, keeping the network decentralized.

Our project is based on the vision of luminaries like Lukejr:

*"Slavery is still moral (unless prohibited by law, in which case it's the sin of disobedience)."* - Luke-jr

*"The Sun really orbits the Earth, not vice-versa."* - Luke-jr

*"Disobedience is wrong. All laws are just by default."* - Luke-jr 

*"As a general principle, it is moral for the State to execute criminals with due process, including heretics."* - Luke-jr
